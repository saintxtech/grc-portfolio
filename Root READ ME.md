# 🛡️ GRC & Cybersecurity Portfolio – Marcus SP

Hey there! I’m Marcus, a cybersecurity professional pivoting into GRC from a leadership background in healthcare operations. This portfolio is where I turn frameworks into reality — not just theory. Each project here is designed to showcase how I’d contribute as a GRC Analyst from Day 1.

## 📂 What's Inside

This repo contains detailed, hands-on GRC projects that follow real frameworks and simulate actual business environments. If you're looking for someone who gets both the policy and the people side of security — you're in the right place.

### 🔸 [OneHealth Risk Assessment](./OneHealth_Risk_Assessment/)
A full enterprise risk assessment based on NIST SP 800-30 and HIPAA Security Rule for a fictional healthcare company.

- Risk methodology: Likelihood × Impact
- Tools: Excel + Word + Real-world structure
- Artifacts: Asset inventory, threat matrix, risk register, final report

## 🧠 What I Bring

- I treat security like a business priority, not just a checklist.
- I write risk assessments that people actually understand.
- I don't just say “HIPAA,” I know what 164.308(a)(3) actually means — and how to mitigate against it.
